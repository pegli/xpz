## A crossword puzzle app for the T-Mobile Sidekick

Back in 2004, I had a series of [Sidekick/Danger Hiptop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Hiptop)
devices and a burning need to code for them, so I wrote this crossword puzzle application and published
it on the app catalog.

This code surely isn't useful to anyone, but it tickles me to publish it, so here it is up on Github.
